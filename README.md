# Advanced_Software_Architectures_TickTackToe
This project involves designing a software architecture in C++ for a 4x4 Tick Tac Toe game using the Minimax Algorithm. The main aim was to create an efficient AI player class. The Minimax Algorithm is optimized with a depth cutoff to handle the complexity, with future potential for Alpha-Beta Pruning.
